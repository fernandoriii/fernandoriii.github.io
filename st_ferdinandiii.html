<p>The father of Ferdinand III was Alfonso IX, king of Leon, and his mother was Berengaria, who was the elder daughter
    of Alfonso III, king of Castile: her mother was a daughter of Henry II of England, and her sister Blanche became
    the mother of St Louis of France. The death of her brother Henry in 1217 left Berengaria heiress to the throne of
    Castile, but she resigned her rights in favour of her eighteen-year-old son Ferdinand. Two years later he married
    Beatrice, daughter of King Philip of Swabia, and they had seven sons and three daughters.</p>
<p>Ferdinand was severe in the administration of justice, but readily forgave personal injuries. His wisdom showed
    itself particularly in the choice he made of governors, magistrates and generals; the archbishop of Toledo, Rodrigo
    Ximenes, was chancellor of Castile and his principal adviser for many years. In 1230, on the death of his father,
    Ferdinand became king also of Leon, but not without strife, for there were those who supported the claim of his two
    half-sisters.</p>
<p>King Ferdinand was the real founder of the great University of Salamanca; but it is as the tireless and successful
    campaigner against the Moors that he impressed himself on the minds and hearts of Spaniards. For twenty-seven years
    he was engaged in almost uninterrupted warfare with the oppressors. He drove them out of Ubeda in 1234, Cordova
    (1236), Murcia, Jaen, Cadiz and finally Seville itself (1249). It was at the battle of Xeres, when only ten Spanish
    lives were lost, that St James was said to have been seen leading the host on a white horse. In thanksgiving for his
    victories, Ferdinand rebuilt the cathedral of Burgos and turned the great mosque of Seville into a church. Unlike
    some warriors he was a forbearing ruler: it is remembered of him that he said that he "feared the curse of one old
    woman more than a whole army of Moors"; and he fought primarily not to extend his territories but to rescue
    Christian people from the dominion of infidels.</p>
<p>On the death of Queen Beatrice, Ferdinand married Joan of Ponthieu, who bore him two sons and a daughter: that
    daughter was Eleanor, who became the wife of Edward I of England. He himself died on May 30, 1252, and was buried in
    the cathedral of Seville in the habit of the Friars Minor. Ferdinand was declared a saint by Pope Clement X in 1671.

<p><small>The Bollandists in the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>, May, vol. vii, have translated into Latin those portions of the
        chronicle of Rodrigo Ximenes, archbishop of Toledo (referred to above), which refer to St Ferdinand. With this
        we have also the summary account of Luke, bishop of Tuy, who was likewise a contemporary, and other
        miscellaneous documents. Further, there is preserved a narrative by the Franciscan, Giles of Zamora (c. a.d.
        1300). This will be found in the <i>Boletin de la real Academia de la Historia</i>, vol. v (1884), pp. 308-321.
        St Ferdinand, of course, plays a conspicuous part in all Spanish histories which cover this period. Among modern
        biographies may be mentioned those by J. Laurentie in French (1910), F. Maccono in Italian (1924), and a popular
        life in Spanish by J. R. Coloma (1928).</small></p>
